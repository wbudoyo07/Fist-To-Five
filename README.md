# Fist-To-Five
Our project is an app that links virtual store items to user a review page via a QR Code scanner.
From a scanned QR code, The landing page will be a review prompt for the item. Once review is submitted, user can read other reviews.
Users can independently go to the site without a QR code, however, as a form of validation, the only way to a review an item will be via taking a photo of the QR code.
QR Codes as well as items will be stored in mysql. App will be written using handlebars.
